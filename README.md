# FriendLeague

This project allows a person to find statistics on a set of players for the League of Legends game.
One example is that there is a group of friends that plays flex games together regularly, this project will 
allow a player to get their list of flex games together and calculate their overall win rate,
their winrate against certain champions, or their winrate whenever they get first dragon or first tower(mini-objectives within the game).
